Welcome to the Dan-project-thunder repository.

Synopsys:
-------------
Here you will find generic Terraform templates which should be used to create and operate your cloud environments.
Until such time that Project Thunder is able to offer a platform where all of this is configured and running
please use the cloud governance principles and guidelines and the Terraform templates provided to operate in the cloud.

We as an organisation should operate in the cloud or in the DC with DevOps best practices. One of the fundamental
component of this is infrastructure as code. Terraform is a infrastructure provisioning and automation tool
written and supported by Hashicorp. Its one tool to rule them all. It is fully open-source with an option to
purchase support and premium version. The Open-source version if perfectly adequate for our use-cases.

We actively encourage the use of Terraform for all things cloud. Avoid using cloud provider specific provisioning tools like
cloud formations, heat templates etc. Or even chef provisioning, ansible etc. With this method, you will only
have to learn Terraform and you will be up to speed in no time.

If you have multiple engineers/developers wanting to use Terraform, please read the following GOTCHA's:

Most of these can be remediated using CI/CD.
